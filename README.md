# React TypeScript User Authentication Example

This is a complete example of user authentication in a React TypeScript application. The example includes features such as user registration, user login, form validation, animations, and more. It leverages libraries like React Router, Axios, Bootstrap, Formik, Yup, and others to build a comprehensive user authentication system.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication Flow:** The project implements a JWT-based authentication flow for both user signup and login.

- **Project Structure:** It provides a well-organized project structure for React TypeScript authentication without Redux. Axios is used for making API requests.

- **Form Validation:** React components with form validation are created using Formik and Yup. This ensures data integrity and user input correctness.

- **Authorization:** Components for accessing protected resources and handling user authorization are included.

- **Animation:** The project demonstrates the creation of animations using the `react-spring` library, adding a dynamic and engaging user experience.

- **File Upload:** It features a file upload component using `react-dropzone`, allowing users to upload files easily.

- **Dynamic Navigation Bar:** The application includes a dynamic navigation bar for seamless navigation between different sections.

- **Table Display:** Data is presented in a tabular format using the `react-table` library with server-side pagination, optimizing the performance of data display.

## Configuration

To configure the project, create a `.env` file in the project directory and set the desired port. For example:

```env
PORT=8081
```
````

## Project Setup

To set up the project, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can use either npm or yarn for this purpose.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server and run the project locally, use the following commands:

### Using npm

```bash
npm start
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn start
```

The project will launch, and you can access it in your web browser at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081). The application will automatically reload when you make changes.

Feel free to customize and extend this example to meet your specific authentication requirements.
